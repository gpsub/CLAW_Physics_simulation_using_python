        ## TODO: Check if we can get only the collide (boolean) without the pygame window, and then return it in real time to the claw
        ## TODO: Make the code so that it can later be compatible with what the rest of the CLAW software works like, it should fit like a glove when you are finished
        ## TODO: For the frames we can train it to 1.move towards the object, 2.Catch the object
        ## TODO: It should be able to 1. Take images from AWS and run it,2. Return the motor control predictions to the actual motor 
        ## since they already have a tried and tested code in place to run the motor, so it should fit in with that, the predictions should also work
        ## TODO: Not  a joke, be serious its an actual company with actual product and professional software
        ## TODO: this environment will return a reward to the RL model(from cv2_code bounding box overlap)

# CLAW robot Physics simulation using Python

- This is a python GUI that simulates the movement of the CLAW robot in water, taking into account drift, inertia, mass, rotational inertia, friction, impulse, collisions, and many other physical parameters.
- A reinforcement learning model has also been trained such that the robot can adjust the angles between its arms to reach the target value
